This is a fandom quiz on marvel made using javascript.

In this quiz I used a method called ReadlineSync() which is used to take input from users in CLI.

Then I made an array of objects of questions to be asked along with its correct answers.

Loop around this array to ask a question in each iteration and if the user's answer is correct 
then update the score by 1 else leave the score as it is.

Finally display the score to user at the end.
